The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results when dealing with percentages and units that aren't compatible. For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(50% - 10em);` might not behave as expected because percentages are relative to the containing element while 'em' units are relative to the font size.  Another issue arises when using `calc()` with multiple percentages that depend on each other; the calculations can cascade incorrectly leading to unintended layouts.  Finally, browser compatibility for complex `calc()` expressions can vary, introducing inconsistencies across different browsers.
